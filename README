# Syriinge Brawlback ASM
Experimental refactor of Brawlback ASM into a REL module file.

# Build Instructions
Note that this only works on Windows at the moment, but simply run make in the root directory after putting the Project+ files into a folder SDCard in the root.

Configure and use MakeSD as desired via tools/MakeSD/Config.ini to build the SD card; note that this can be done in Dolphin as well, it's just faster (and only available on Windows).

To run MakeSD, run the command "./tools/MakeSD/main.bat" from PowerShell in the root.
